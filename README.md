# Astro_lab 2022/2023

This repo  encodes several jupyter notebooks  aimed at familiarizing Astrophysics students to python and all the functionalities related to analysis of astrophysics data. The content of the notebooks are presented in the `Astrophysics Laboratory` classes of the 2nd term  at University of Catania.  



### Using Google Co-Lab 
Load the notebook of each class here:  https://colab.research.google.com/ 
 

### Running locally 
Firstly make sure you've an updated version of conda. 
`conda update python; conda update conda` 

then make a new conda environment : 
`conda create -n astrolab`

 and install the following  `python packages`: 
 
 - `conda install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter astropy sympy` 
 - jupyterlab `conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`
 - healpy `conda install -c conda-forge healpy` 
 - wget `pip install wget`
